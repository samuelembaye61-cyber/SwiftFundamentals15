## App Exercise - Mile Times and Congratulations
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 The `RunningWorkout` struct below holds information about your users' running workouts. However, you decide to add information about average mile time. Add a computed property called `averageMileTime` that uses `distance` and `time` to compute the user's average mile time. Assume that `distance` is in meters and 1600 meters is a mile.
 
 Create an instance of `RunningWorkout` and print the `averageMileTime` property. Check that it works properly.
 */
struct RunningWorkout {
    var distance: Double
    var time: Double
    var elevation: Double
    var averageMileTime: Double {
        let miles = distance / 1600
        return time / miles
    }
}
myRun = RunningWorkout(distance: 3200, time: 30, elevation: 100)
print("Average mile time: \(myRun.averageMileTime) minutes")

/*:
 In other app exercises, you've provided encouraging messages to the user based on how many steps they've completed. A great place to check whether or not you should display something to the user is in a property observer.
 
 In the `Steps` struct below, add a `willSet` to the `steps` property that will check if the new value is equal to `goal`, and if it is, prints a congratulatory message. 
 Create an instance of `Steps` where `steps` is 9999 and `goal` is 10000, then call `takeStep()` and see if your message is printed to the console.
 */
struct Steps {
    var steps: Int
    var goal: Int
    
    mutating func takeStep() {
        steps += 1
    }
    willSet {
        if newValue == goal {
            print("Congratulations! You've reached your step goal for the day!")
        }
    }

}

var mySteps = Steps(steps: 9999, goal: 10000)
mySteps.takeStep()
print("Steps after: \(mySteps.steps)")
